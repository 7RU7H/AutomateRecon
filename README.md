# AutomateRecon

This Automation setup most designed to force myself to have organised directory structures for reporting and information management. It will remain modular for the purpose of making the user choose what to do in a more tacticool way - Observe, Orient, Decide, Act.


Disclaimer if you are beginner I highly recommend:
- Forget Automation for awhile - learn it properly
- Learn Nmap - go away and just read the nmap documentation
- Running scans is not 1337, being able to perform and understand manually what you are doing is very important
- You will need to run full slower port scans regardless for the sake of professionalism and you mental health 
- This will not replace the expertise of making Nuclei Templates
- It has a terrible name and will hopefully be replaced



# Plans

Masscan scripts will be kept, but I moving  to replace it with either my own version of Rustscan that is more like masscan (not nmap with Rust-bolted on let nmap be nmap), Rustscan, but more likely Naabu but I will also script for both:
- Naabu and Rustscan, because I like them both        

Add more scripts for:
- Setup 
- Networking 
- Information management
